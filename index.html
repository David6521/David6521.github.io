      <p>
          <br>This is my website that has a collection of programs that I coded in my CSC106 class at the <a href="http://uri.edu.">University of Rhode Island.</a> 
          <br>This website was written in HTML programming language that I learned in my class. The buttons above take you to 
          <br>different websites I also wrote containing javascript programs I wrote and an about me section. </p>
